##Info about the assignment : 
In this project, I use the Reactjs library, and for dummy data, I use: https://dummyjson.com/products, It gives me a list of 30 products so I can show it to my application.
I have made a price filter that contains a range: from - to (ex: 500Rs - 800Rs) 
It is fully responsive, and I have used MUI Icons for the responsive menu icon.
